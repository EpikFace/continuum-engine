# Weapon Mergeer - A Continuum Engine example game

An example of how to build a merge incremental game

## How to run

1. You need a web-server. I suggest installed [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
2. Once you have the server, simply type: `http-server .` (don't forget the trailing .)
