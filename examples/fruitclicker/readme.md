# Fruit Clicker - A Continuum Engine example game

An example of how to build a basic Cookie Clicker clone game using the Continuum Engine.

## How to run

1. You need a web-server. I suggest installed [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
2. Once you have the server, simply type: `http-server .` (don't forget the trailing .)
